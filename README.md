# GoogleSheets-Webhook-Todoist
A Google Sheets script I created to import Todoist completed tasks via a Webhook (https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/#webhooks)  to a Google Sheet

This is specifically customized for task:completed so I can do some google data studio dashboard work against my completed tasks, so it doesn't include variables I dont' care about.
